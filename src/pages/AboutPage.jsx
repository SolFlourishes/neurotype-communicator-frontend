      <p className="mission"><strong>Our Mission:</strong> To translate communication styles, not people. We believe that clearer communication builds more inclusive, effective, and compassionate workplaces and communities.</p>

        <h3 className="font-bold text-lg mb-2">The Challenge</h3>
        <p>Ever feel like you're speaking clearly but your message doesn't land? This often happens because we're running on different communication "operating systems"â€”one prioritizing directness and data, the other social rapport and context.</p>
      </div>
      <div className="bg-gray-50">
        <h3 className="font-bold text-lg mb-2">The Solution</h3>
        <p>This tool acts as a bridge, not a correction tool. It translates messages between communication styles, helping neurodivergent and neurotypical individuals understand each other more clearly without changing who they are.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3 text-gray-700">Important Limitations & Our Guiding Philosophy</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-4 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Neurodiversity is a Spectrum:</strong> We use "ND" and "NT" to describe communication *styles*, not to rigidly label people.</li>
          <li><strong>Context is Everything:</strong> The tool analyzes text, but it cannot analyze the tone of a room or your relationship with the other person.</li>
          <li><strong>Verification is Key:</strong> The ultimate goal is better human connection. The AI can be wrong. Always verify understanding through direct conversation.</li>
